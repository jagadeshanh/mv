Now the question may arise in your mind, what is Search Engine Optimization? You can of course Google it but, we are here to save your time. So, Search Engine Optimization is a process of amplifying the website visibility on search engine result pages by adding search friendly elements to a website.<br>
 
You’re probably thinking, why do I need SEO? To answer that, just think about how you normally find the information you need during your everyday life. 
Where would you look if you were on vacation and needed to find a restaurant for dinner?
How would you go about researching your options for learning cooking or playing guitar?
If you’re like most people, you’d type a simple phrase into Google.
You would search “restaurants near me,” or “how to learn guitar.” Then, you’d scroll through the results and click the one best suited to your needs.<br>
These results are based on the keywords you entered and on what Google thinks will be the most helpful information to you. So, the sites you see on the first page didn’t get there by accident, they used SEO and extensive research to determine how users usually phrase their search topics and optimized the page accordingly.<br>
Done right, SEO can get quality traffic to your website, boost lead generation and offer higher ROI that helps grow your business.<br>
