            		<p class="text-justify mb-0">
<ol>
<li>We <strong>Strategize</strong> by personalizing and segmenting Emails.</li>
<li>We then perform a <strong>Database Audit</strong> in which we collate a mailing list of subscribed recipients, reformat your mailing list and audit the pertinent accounts and contacts.</li>
<li>From there we <strong>Design Emails</strong> which supports both desktop and mobile. We build crisp and relevant content and integrate the media files whenever required.</li>
<li>A <strong>Campaign is then set up</strong> after assessing the best day and time. We then draft an Email campaign which usually is a monthly or a quarterly exercise</li>
<li>We <strong>Monitor</strong> the page after every campaign. CTR (Click-through rate), Bounces, Subscribed/Unsubscribed, Forwards, Conversion rates., we tackle it all.</li>
<li>After measuring the statistics from the campaign, we generate a <strong>Report</strong> to align the efforts of the sales and marketing team. We try new campaign models and A/B testing in Email designs.</li>
<li>We then <strong>Analyse</strong> what worked and what did not. Using this data, we sit with you and discuss the roadmap, well-armed with information, and then you’re on your way to a stronger and more effective email campaign.</li>
